## Overview

**Nekiro Rcc Editor** is a powerful desktop application built with Electron, React, and TypeScript that simplifies the process of editing Qt Resource Collection (.rcc) files. This tool is particularly valuable for game developers and modders working with Tibia game clients, as it provides an intuitive interface for replacing and extracting assets stored in compiled Qt resource files.

The application addresses the complex challenge of working with binary resource files by providing a user-friendly graphical interface, making it accessible to developers who need to modify game UI elements, images, fonts, and styles.

## What are Qt Resource Collection (.rcc) Files?

**Qt Resource Collection (.rcc) files** are compiled binary files used by Qt applications to store and manage resources such as:

- **Images and Icons:** UI graphics, sprites, and visual assets
- **Fonts:** Custom typefaces and text rendering resources
- **Stylesheets:** CSS-like styling information for UI components
- **Data Files:** Configuration files, translations, and other static data
- **Media Assets:** Audio files, videos, and other multimedia content

### Key Characteristics:

- **Binary Format:** Compiled from human-readable resource files (.qrc) into efficient binary format
- **Embedded Resources:** Resources are embedded directly into the application executable
- **Platform Independent:** Works across different operating systems
- **Efficient Access:** Fast runtime access to embedded resources
- **Version Control:** Single file contains all application resources

### In Game Development Context:

In the context of Tibia game clients, .rcc files are crucial for:

- **UI Customization:** Modifying game interface elements and layouts
- **Asset Replacement:** Swapping game graphics, icons, and visual elements
- **Theme Development:** Creating custom visual themes and styles
- **Localization:** Managing different language assets and translations
- **Modding:** Enabling community modifications and custom content

## ‚ùì Problem

Developers and modders working with Tibia game clients faced several challenges:

1. **Complex Binary Format:** .rcc files are compiled binary formats that are difficult to edit manually
2. **No User-Friendly Tools:** Existing tools for .rcc manipulation were command-line based and complex
3. **Asset Management:** Difficulty in replacing and extracting specific resources from compiled files
4. **UI Modification Challenges:** Hard to modify game interface elements without proper tools
5. **Error-Prone Process:** Manual editing often led to corrupted files and broken applications
6. **Limited Documentation:** Lack of clear documentation for working with .rcc files
7. **Cross-Platform Issues:** Need for tools that work across different operating systems

---

## üéØ Goal

1. Create an intuitive desktop application for .rcc file editing
2. Provide graphical interface for resource replacement and extraction
3. Enable easy modification of Tibia game client assets
4. Support both loading and compiling .rcc files
5. Ensure cross-platform compatibility
6. Provide comprehensive error handling and validation
7. Make the tool accessible to non-technical users
