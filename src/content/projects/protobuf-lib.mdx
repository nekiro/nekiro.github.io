## Overview

**ProtobufLib** is a specialized C++11 library designed to streamline Open Tibia development by providing efficient parsing and exporting capabilities for appearance data stored in Protocol Buffers (protobuf) files. This library serves as a crucial development tool for managing game client data, including assets, sprites, and objects, making it easier for developers to create and customize their own Tibia servers.

The library abstracts the complexity of working with protobuf files in the context of game development, providing a clean and efficient interface for extracting and manipulating game data.

## What is Protocol Buffers?

**Protocol Buffers (protobuf)** is an open-source, language-neutral, and platform-neutral data serialization format developed by Google. It provides an efficient way to serialize structured data for use in communications protocols, data storage, and more.

Key characteristics of Protocol Buffers:
- **Language Neutral:** Works across multiple programming languages
- **Platform Independent:** Functions on any operating system
- **Efficient:** Compact binary format with fast serialization/deserialization
- **Extensible:** Easy to add new fields without breaking existing code
- **Type Safe:** Strong typing system prevents common data errors

In the context of game development, protobuf is particularly valuable for storing complex game data structures like player information, world state, and asset metadata in a compact, efficient format.

## What is Open Tibia?

**Open Tibia** is an open-source project that emulates the mechanics and gameplay of the original Tibia MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game). It provides a platform for developers and gaming enthusiasts to:

- Create and customize their own Tibia servers
- Experiment with game mechanics and content
- Develop new features and modifications
- Build communities around custom game experiences

Open Tibia servers allow for complete customization of the game world, including:
- Custom maps and environments
- Modified gameplay mechanics
- New items, spells, and creatures
- Custom quests and storylines
- Server-specific rules and economies

The project enables developers to understand and modify the underlying game systems, making it a valuable educational and creative platform for game development.

## ‚ùì Problem

Open Tibia developers faced several challenges when working with game client data:

1. **Complex Data Format:** Game assets and appearance data were stored in protobuf format, requiring specialized knowledge to parse
2. **Manual Data Extraction:** No efficient tools existed for extracting and manipulating game client data
3. **Asset Management:** Difficulty in managing and organizing game sprites, objects, and other visual assets
4. **Development Bottlenecks:** Time-consuming manual processes slowed down server development and customization
5. **Data Integrity:** Risk of data corruption when manually editing game files
6. **Limited Documentation:** Lack of clear documentation for working with Tibia's data structures

---

## üéØ Goal

1. Create a robust C++ library for parsing protobuf files in Open Tibia context
2. Provide efficient data extraction and export capabilities
3. Enable easy manipulation of game assets and appearance data
4. Improve development workflow for Open Tibia server creators
5. Ensure data integrity and prevent corruption during data manipulation
6. Create comprehensive documentation and examples
