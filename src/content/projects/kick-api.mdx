## Overview

**Kick API** is a comprehensive JavaScript library that simplifies interaction with the Kick.com streaming platform API. Designed for developers building chatbots, analytics tools, and streaming integrations, it provides a clean interface for accessing Kick's features programmatically.

The library abstracts the complexity of Kick's API endpoints while providing real-time capabilities through WebSocket connections, making it easy for developers to create powerful streaming applications.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Role

**API Developer** and **Library Architect**

---

## ‚ùì Problem

Developers working with Kick.com faced several challenges:

1. Lack of official comprehensive API documentation
2. Complex authentication flows and endpoint management
3. No standardized way to handle real-time chat and events
4. Inconsistent data formats across different API endpoints
5. Difficulty in building reliable streaming applications and bots

---

## üéØ Goal

1. Create a unified JavaScript library for Kick.com API interaction
2. Implement real-time chat and event monitoring capabilities
3. Provide comprehensive documentation and examples
4. Ensure reliable error handling and rate limiting
5. Support both browser and Node.js environments

## ‚ú® Solution

### Library Architecture

The library provides a modular approach to Kick API interaction:

- **Authentication Module:** OAuth flow management and token handling
- **Chat API:** Real-time chat message monitoring and sending
- **Channel API:** Stream information and channel data retrieval
- **User API:** User profile and statistics access
- **Events API:** Real-time stream events and notifications

### Developer Experience

Focused on simplicity and reliability:

- Promise-based API with async/await support
- TypeScript definitions for better developer experience
- Comprehensive error handling with meaningful error messages
- Built-in rate limiting to prevent API abuse
- Extensive documentation with practical examples
