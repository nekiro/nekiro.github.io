## ‚ùì Problem

Traditional Open Tibia Server AACs faced several challenges:

1. Outdated PHP-based systems with security vulnerabilities
2. Poor user experience and non-responsive designs
3. Lack of real-time server status monitoring
4. Insecure session management and data handling
5. Limited character and guild management features

---

## üéØ Goal

1. Create a modern, secure AAC using current web technologies
2. Implement real-time server monitoring via socket connections
3. Provide responsive design for all device types
4. Ensure secure user authentication and data protection
5. Build scalable architecture for growing OT communities

## ‚ú® Solution

### Technical Architecture

The application uses a modern tech stack:

- **Next.js** for server-side rendering and optimal performance
- **TypeScript** for type safety and better development experience
- **MySQL** for reliable data storage
- **Socket connections** for real-time protocol status parsing
- **Encrypted cookies** for secure session management

### Key Features Implemented

1. **Account Management:** Secure registration, login, and character creation
2. **Real-time Monitoring:** Live server status and player count via socket protocol
3. **Character System:** Complete character management with statistics
4. **Guild System:** Guild creation and management features
5. **Security:** Encrypted sessions and secure API endpoints
6. **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach for all devices

## üß™ Challenges and Learnings

1. **Protocol Integration:** Implementing socket-based communication with OT servers required deep understanding of the protocol structure
2. **Security Implementation:** Balancing user experience with robust security measures in a gaming environment
3. **Performance Optimization:** Ensuring fast loading times while handling real-time data updates
4. **Cross-platform Compatibility:** Supporting various OT server distributions and versions

---

## ‚ú® Final Thoughts

1. **Modern Architecture Pays Off:** Using Next.js and TypeScript significantly improved development speed and code maintainability
2. **Security First Approach:** Implementing proper security measures from the start prevented common vulnerabilities found in legacy AACs
3. **Community Impact:** The project received positive feedback from the OT community and influenced other AAC projects to modernize
4. **Open Source Benefits:** Making the project open source allowed community contributions and faster bug resolution
